      "news_title": "Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Review",
      "image": "images/tab2.jpeg",
      "news_body": "<p>Android tablets are don&#39;t seem to be as popular as they once were, and&nbsp;very few manufacturers are launching new models these days. Some companies that are still making Android tablets, such as Xiaomi, aren&#39;t bringing them to the Indian market. However, Samsung is one player that has been manufacturing and launching a variety of tablets in the country quite regularly&nbsp;for some time now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recently reviewed the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e, and we liked it for offering a good experience at a relatively attractive&nbsp;price. While the Tab S5e is a prime example of an affordable Android tablet, the more recently launched Galaxy Tab S6 is pitched as the best tablet that Samsung has to offer. So should you invest in a Galaxy tablet, or would you be better off with an Apple iPad? We put it to the test to find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 design and specifications</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lte-price-in-india-91202\" target=\"_self\">Samsung Galaxy Tab S6</a>₹ 59,900&nbsp;isn&#39;t the successor to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s5e-lte-12055\" target=\"_self\">Galaxy Tab S5e</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tablets/reviews/samsung-galaxy-tab-s5e-review-india-price-2070286\" target=\"_self\">Review</a>) which we recently reviewed. Here in India, if you are looking for something more powerful than the Galaxy Tab S5e,&nbsp;the Galaxy Tab S6 will be among the very few options that you&#39;ll find. This premium Android tablet sports a 10.5-inch AMOLED display with a WQXGA resolution (1600x2560 pixels).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The display has sizeable bezels all around which is acceptable considering the size of the device. You do need at least some bezels on a tablet to be able to hold it without touching the screen.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tablets/samsung-tablets\" target=\"_self\">Samsung</a>&nbsp;has also added an in-display fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy Tab S6 but isn&#39;t the ultra-sonic kind found on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-8940\" target=\"_self\">Galaxy S10</a>₹ 61,900&nbsp;series. Instead, it uses an optical CMOS sensor. You&#39;ll notice that this AMOLED display lights up around the fingerprint scanner when in use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At 5.7mm in thickness, the Galaxy Tab S6 is sleek, but its 7040mAh battery makes it heavy at 420g. One-handed use is very awkward due to the weight and bulk of the device. The&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy Tab S6&nbsp;comes in Wi-Fi and LTE variants, and it seems that the company has only launched the LTE option in India. Samsung has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right side, along with a microphone hole and the SIM tray which can hold one Nano-SIM and a microSD card.</p>",

      "image": "images/gad5.jpeg",
      "news_body": "<p>The Type-C port has been around for a while now, and most, if not all, Android flagship smartphones these days sport the modern USB port. In the last few months, we&#39;ve seen it trickle down the price points, and it&#39;s no longer uncommon to see phones under Rs. 15,000 ship with a Type-C port. However, most affordable phones ship with chargers that still have the Type-A (or as you probably know it, the &ldquo;regular&rdquo;/ &ldquo;big&rdquo; USB port). That means you use a Type-A to Type-C cable for charging, so you won&#39;t need any extra cables if you are in the market for a power bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, if you have a phone that ships with a Type-C charger &mdash; like most flagships do &mdash; and a cable that&#39;s Type-C at both ends, or if you are someone who is trying to go all-in with the Type-C lifestyle &mdash; maybe using an iPad Pro or a MacBook Air &mdash; your choices in terms of accessories &mdash; and especially power banks &mdash; can be pretty limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most power banks out there have regular Type-A USB ports for output and a Micro-USB port to charge the power bank itself, which means you will need to carry around two extra cables just to make the power bank work for you. Then there are others &mdash; such as the Mi Power Bank Pro &mdash; that feature a Type-C port, but it is only to charge the power bank itself, and it cannot be used for output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finding a power bank with Type-C output in India was a surprisingly difficult task, but we managed to find a few models. We then proceeded to use these in the real world over a few weeks as well as run them through a standard set of tests in our labs.</p>",

Tesla says the Semi with its four motors is capable of going from 0 to 60mph in 20 seconds when carrying 20,000 pounds, 65mph per hour uphill, and travelling 500 miles on a single charge with max load. Diesel trucks are capable of travelling up to 1,000 miles (1,600 km) on a single tank of fuel. Production is said to begin in 2019, with a $5,000 (roughly Rs. 3,24,000) reservation open now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla also unveiled the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/transportation/news/tesla-roadster-unveiled-claimed-to-be-fastest-production-car-ever-1776654\">new Roadster</a>, and called it the world&#39;s fastest production car. The sports car is an updated version of Tesla&#39;s first production vehicle. It can seat four and travel 620 miles (1,000 km) on a single charge, a new record for an electric vehicle, Musk said. It can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour (100 km per hour) in 1.9 seconds, which would make it the fastest car in general production.</p>",

      "image": "images/lap1.jpeg",
      "news_body": "<p>There&rsquo;sThere&rsquo;s&nbsp;really just one thing you need to know about the latest Spectre x360 13 from HP: the trackpad doesn&rsquo;t suck. For years, HP has built excellent laptops under the Spectre branding that have all been let down by terrible trackpads. The company insisted on sticking with poor performing Synaptics drivers, even while the rest of the Windows laptop industry (including HP&rsquo;s own business laptops) switched to the far superior Precision drivers provided by Microsoft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But HP has seen the error of its ways (or it got tired of reading&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18274004/hp-spectre-x360-13-2018-review-price-specs-features\">reviews</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18196266/hp-spectre-folio-leather-laptop-convertible-2-in-1-review-specs-price-features\">bemoaning</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761153/hp-spectre-x360-15-amoled-oled-laptop-review-price-specs-features\">its trackpads</a>), and the new Spectre x360 13 finally uses Microsoft&rsquo;s Precision drivers. Combined with a smooth glass surface and large size, it is now a good trackpad. The latest x360 also has an updated chassis with slimmer bezels, Intel&rsquo;s 10th Gen processors, and an aggressive starting price of $1,099 ($1,299, as reviewed).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spectre x360 has long been a strong contender in the world of premium 2-in-1 convertible Windows laptops, with the aforementioned trackpad issues being the main thing that held it back. But this year, it has some serious competition from Dell, with its latest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20958296/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-laptop-convertible-intel-ice-lake-review-test-price-specs-features\">XPS 13 2-in-1</a>, including similar internal components and an updated design, not to mention an excellent trackpad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, HP holds its own, and choosing between the two will really come down to personal preference and how much you&rsquo;re willing to spend on a new laptop.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>OUR REVIEW OF<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/products/spectre-x360-13-late-2019/9249\">HP SPECTRE X360 13 (LATE 2019)</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>VERGE SCORE8OUT OF 10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/hermano/verge/product/image/9249/awhite_191210_3831_0132_squ.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>GOOD STUFF</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>More compact design than prior x360 models</li>\r\n\t<li>Finally, a good trackpad</li>\r\n\t<li>Windows Hello-compatible camera and fingerprint sensor</li>\r\n\t<li>Snappy performance, plus an integrated LTE option</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>BAD STUFF</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Only average battery life</li>\r\n\t<li>It&rsquo;s time for the 16:9 screen to die</li>\r\n\t<li>Annoying bloatware</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://fave.co/2rQBHfW\">Buy for $1,099.99&nbsp;from HP</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-spectre-x360-2-in-1-13-3-laptop-intel-core-i7-8gb-memory-512gb-ssd-32gb-optane-natural-silver-aluminum-stamping-base%2F6376412.p%3FskuId%3D6376412&amp;sharedid=verge&amp;subId1=xid:fr1576580603703dge\">Buy for $1,299.99&nbsp;from Best Buy</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newest Spectre x360 looks very similar to the prior models, but HP has made some crucial tweaks and improvements to the design. The most important one is smaller bezels all around the screen, which not only look more modern and bring HP in line with what Dell has offered for years, but they also allow the machine to have a smaller footprint than before. The x360 is now nearly a full inch shorter than the prior model, but it has the same 13.3-inch display. HP boasts that the x360 13 is now the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s smallest convertible with 90 percent screen-to-body ratio,&rdquo; which is such a hilariously heavily qualified claim that I had to share it with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with those shrunken bezels, HP still managed to include a Windows Hello-compatible webcam above the display, something Dell doesn&rsquo;t offer. There&rsquo;s even a hardware kill switch on the side of the computer for privacy protection, though I&rsquo;d have preferred a physical shutter like the one found on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/13/21020445/hp-elite-dragonfly-laptop-convertible-review-price-specs-features\">HP&rsquo;s Elite Dragonfly business laptop</a>. If you don&rsquo;t want to use facial recognition to log in, there&rsquo;s a Windows Hello fingerprint scanner just below the keyboard that works exactly as you&rsquo;d expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oV-Lr9ftl34X1TTd0XqDMCQyVyM=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19500442/awhite_191210_3831_0033.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Spectre x360 13 has a smaller footprint than Dell&rsquo;s XPS 13 2-in-1.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lqS647SOpjoAOHnYyEo3m75jyzU=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19500727/awhite_191210_3831_0100.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>HP managed to fit a Windows Hello-compatible webcam inside the small bezel above the display.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the shrinking, HP moved the speakers from just above the keyboard to the underside of the laptop where most 2-in-1 computers have them. I didn&rsquo;t really notice a huge difference in the speaker performance with the change &mdash; they are still loud and clear and sounded quite nice when watching the latest season of&nbsp;<em>The Expanse</em>&nbsp;or in video calls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, despite offering three different display configurations, including a 4K OLED option, HP is still using a 16:9 aspect ratio, which isn&rsquo;t as comfortable to use for productivity work as a 3:2 or even 16:10 screen. That cramped feeling is magnified on a 13.3-inch screen, and it just feels so much smaller than the XPS 13 2-in-1&rsquo;s or Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Laptop 3 when browsing the web or working in documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The review unit I&rsquo;ve been testing has HP&rsquo;s low-power 1W 1080p display, which is bright and vibrant and works well for both everyday work and media consumption. It&rsquo;s not as punchy and jaw-dropping as the OLED screen would be, but it has better battery life and a much lower price tag so it&rsquo;s likely the best option for most people. The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&rsquo;s display beats this one in max brightness and aspect ratio, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new x360 has the same sharp-to-touch and sharp-to-look-at beveled sides as the last few iterations. It also has the same port selection: two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports and a microSD card slot on the right and a 3.5mm audio jack and USB-A port on the left. The USB-A port is now half-covered by a trap door that I assume allows HP to fit it in a thinner chassis. Despite the trap door, I was still able to plug USB cables into the port with one hand, though it does take a little more deliberate action than before. Either way, Dell&rsquo;s computer doesn&rsquo;t even have a USB-A port, so this is a win for HP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DGyiV7jrJfFjw50_yrBDHoN68s8=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19500534/awhite_191210_3831_0068.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>There&rsquo;s a trapdoor obscuring half of the USB-A port, but it&rsquo;s still possible to plug in cables with just one hand.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The backlit keyboard is unchanged from prior models, save for the addition of a microphone mute key in the function row. It&rsquo;s a perfectly fine keyboard, with good spacing and travel, though the column of cursor control keys on the right side makes the whole thing feel a little off-center, which takes some getting used to. HP&rsquo;s keycaps are a little slippery as well, but overall, the keyboard is much more traditional-feeling than Dell&rsquo;s polarizing low-profile keyboard on the XPS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, the trackpad on the x360 is much better than before, even though it has the same dimensions and glass construction as prior models. The upgraded drivers mean everything from single finger tracking to two-finger scrolling to multifinger Windows 10 gestures are much more reliable and easier to use than on prior models. Perhaps the most significant change is the improved palm rejection; my cursor doesn&rsquo;t jump erratically across the screen nearly as often when I&rsquo;m typing in a document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many other recent laptops, the Spectre x360 has Intel&rsquo;s latest 10th Gen Core processors, in either i5 or i7 options. They are paired with the much-improved Iris Plus integrated graphics, which don&rsquo;t exactly turn the x360 into a gaming computer but do help a ton with creativity workflows in apps like Photoshop and Premiere Pro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OwC3VHmiEPGs-8JIQM46X5UOKDg=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19500627/awhite_191210_3831_0085.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The x360&rsquo;s keyboard is well-sized and has good travel. And the trackpad finally works as it should.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My review unit has the Core i7-1065G7 chip with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage (boosted by 32GB of Intel&rsquo;s high-speed Optane storage). It performs very similarly to other computers with this platform and has no issues handling everyday workflows of dozens of Chrome tabs, writing in Word, communicating in Slack, and keeping up with Twitter and email. It can also handle streaming 4K video from YouTube without any issue, as you&rsquo;d expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The x360 supports Wi-Fi 6 and has an option for integrated gigabit LTE, though my review unit was not equipped with the latter. Few consumer-focused laptops even provide the option for LTE at this point, so it&rsquo;s nice to see HP ahead of the curve here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HP loves to make huge battery life claims based on local video or audio playback loops, but in mixed usage, the x360 is no different than every other modern thin-and-light laptop or 2-in-1. With my usual workflow and the brightness set to 50 percent, I averaged just under seven hours between charges, which is right in line with every other 13-inch 10th Gen laptop I&rsquo;ve tested. That&rsquo;s not quite a full day of use (and not nearly as impressive as the double-digit battery life I saw from prior x360 models), but unfortunately, it seems to be about all we&rsquo;re going to get with current options.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>AGREE TO CONTINUE: HP SPECTRE X360 13 (LATE 2019)</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it &mdash; contracts that no one actually reads. It&rsquo;s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit &ldquo;agree&rdquo; to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don&rsquo;t read and definitely can&rsquo;t negotiate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with other Windows 10 computers, the HP Spectre x360 13 presents you with multiple things to agree to or decline upon setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mandatory policies, for which an agreement is required, are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 10 License Agreement</li>\r\n\t<li>A Microsoft account for sign-in (this can be bypassed if you don&rsquo;t connect the computer to the internet during setup)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, there is a slew of optional things to agree to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Activity History</li>\r\n\t<li>OneDrive back up</li>\r\n\t<li>Office 365</li>\r\n\t<li>Cortana (which allows Microsoft to access your location, location history, contacts, voice input, speech and handwriting patterns, typing history, search history, calendar details, messages, apps, and Edge browsing history)</li>\r\n\t<li>Device privacy settings: online speech recognition, Find My Device, Inking and Typing, Advertising ID, Location, Diag data, Tailored experiences</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Add it all up, and you have two mandatory agreements and 11 optional ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, while I didn&rsquo;t encounter any notable bugs or software issues on the x360 in my week or so of testing, I have to note that HP still includes annoying bloatware like McAfee trials on all of its consumer laptops, even ones that cost well north of $1,000. It&rsquo;s an annoying and frustrating thing to deal with on an otherwise excellent laptop, and HP should give it up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a new thin-and-light laptop or 2-in-1 right now, the top options are this Spectre x360, Dell&rsquo;s XPS 13 2-in-1, or Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Laptop 3. All three have sleek, modern designs, similar performance and battery life, excellent keyboards and trackpads, and bright, sharp displays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mYvH_y_0KjnZJmyCn4kWiRsy9qo=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19500913/awhite_191210_3831_0138.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spectre gives you the smallest footprint of all of them, plus both Thunderbolt 3 (which is not found on the Surface Laptop 3) and USB-A ports (which are lacking on the XPS 13 2-in-1), and it comes in at a lower price when similarly configured. The main thing you give up with the Spectre is the better screen ratios found on the Dell or Microsoft computers, which may be a deal-breaker for some. Frankly, it is for me. I much prefer a taller aspect ratio for everyday work.

It comes equipped with a 13.3-inch touchscreen display that can be configured in three different ways, including a low-power 1080p mode that&rsquo;s meant to conserve battery life when compared to its 4k configuration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The built in webcam and fingerprint sensor are both compatible with Windows Hello, allowing the user the option of biometric authentication for added security.

      "image": "images/mob3.jpeg",
      "news_body": "<p>Xiaomi, it appears, is gearing up for an explosive start to the new year. According to a recent report by Chinese media outlet&nbsp;<a href=\"https://t.cj.sina.com.cn/articles/view/1826017320/6cd6d02802000mlul\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">IT House</a>&nbsp;on one of Sina Corp&#39;s websites, the launch of the Xiaomi Mi 10 smartphone has been confirmed to take place in the first quarter of 2020. The news reportedly comes from the Public Relations Manager of Redmi TV, a user who is identified on leaked screenshots online as &lsquo;Panda&rsquo;. With any luck, the new smartphone should sport the recently announced Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chipset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though we don&#39;t have an exact date for the launch of the new Xiaomi Mi 10, we know that it will happen in the first quarter of 2020. Apart from this, we know very little about the Xiaomi Mi 10. Lin Bin, the Founder and President of Xiaomi Corporation, announced at Qualcomm&#39;s annual Tech Summit event in Hawaii that the Xiaomi Mi 10 would be one of the first smartphones to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Mobile Platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon 865 chipset is a successor to the Snapdragon 855 chipset that&#39;s currently seen doing duty on flagship-grade smartphones such as the OnePlus 7/7 Pro, Redmi K20 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy S10 series. Qualcomm claims the new Snapdragon 865 delivers a 25-per cent boost in performance and power efficiency even though it employs the same subsystem architecture as its predecessor with very little change to the cores&#39; clock speeds. You can read more about it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.digit.in/news/mobile-phones/snapdragon-865-detailed-ai-camera-and-gaming-in-focus-this-year-51277.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Xiaomi launched the Mi 9 smartphone with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset in several markets earlier this year but did not bring it to India. It features a 6.39-inch Super AMOLED display with Full HD+ resolution. It comes with up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage space. It has a triple camera setup on its back panel, including a 48MP primary sensor with f/1.8 aperture. The selfie camera is a single 20MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.digit.in/mobile-phones/xiaomi-mi-9-price-177439.html\">Xiaomi Mi 9</a>&nbsp;is powered by a 3300mAh battery that supports 27W fast charging and 20W wireless charging. The handset runs MIUI 10 based on Android 9 Pie.</p>",

The Precision 5540 takes the 15.6-inch, 4K OLED display, slim design and powerful performance from the XPS 15. Unfortunately, the Precision doesn&#39;t inherit the XPS&#39; amazing battery life, but the Precision 5540 is one of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-workstation-laptops\"><u>best workstations</u></a>&nbsp;on the market. And if you love the XPS 15, you&#39;ll love this workhorse version of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s Note:</strong></em><em>&nbsp;We previously stated that the Precision 5540 was not Mil-Spec tested, which was incorrect, and we have corrected the following review accordingly.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dell Precision 5540 price and configuration options</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The base model of the Dell Precision 5540 costs $1,219 and comes with an Intel Core i5-9400H processor, an Intel UHD 630 GPU, 8GB of RAM, a 500GB 7,200-rpm HDD and a 1080p display. I tested the $3,197 version, which comes with an Intel Core i9-9980HK CPU, Nvidia Quadro T2000 GPU with 4GB of VRAM, 32GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD and a 4K OLED display. You can also max this baby out at a meaty $4,420, upping it to an Intel Xeon E-2276M CPU, 64GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD and a 2TB HDD.</p>",

      "news_title": "Dell Latitude 7400 2-in-1 Review: A Business Laptop With a Pleasing Personality",
      "image": "images/lap4.jpeg",
      "news_body": "<p>Is it just me, or do laptops that are classified as &ldquo;business laptops&rdquo; just look plain and simple boring? Bereft of any personality, colour and look like their entire existence is meant for a purpose of being slaves in the corporate world? Much like the companies that bought them and the human slaves that use them? If you agree with me, chances are you would appreciate of the way the Microsoft Surface computing devices and the Apple MacBook do the blend of the best of both worlds, without leaning too much to one side. They are not boring. Simple. Perfect time then, for the Dell Latitude 7400 2-in-1 convertible computing device to make its presence felt. And it is absolutely fantastic that the inspiration comes from the gorgeous Dell XPS 13 laptop and its equally beautiful iterations over the years. The Dell Latitude 7400 2-in-1 simply takes a bucket load of inspiration, adds a few more of goodies and what you have is a very capable business laptop. There are three variants on sale right now&mdash;with prices starting at around Rs 1,14,810 and going all the way to around Rs 1,38,368 depending of which variant you pick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dell offers the options of the 8th generation Intel Core i5 and Core i7 vPro processor options. There are also configurations that offer 8GB RAM and 16GB RAM. There is the Intel Core i5-8265U and the Intel Core i7-8665U. One may argue that 8th generation is perhaps a tad older than ideal, but then again, business users wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily feel the need. You can choose between 128GB SSD, a 256GB SSD or a 512GB SSD. What we have here is the top spec variant, with a Core i7, 16GB RAM and 512GB storage. The performance is nothing short of buttery smooth, as one would expect from such a powerful configuration. But what does that mean for the battery life? The Dell Latitude 7400 2-in-1 is a battery life monster. There is no other way of putting it. Dell claims as much as 26 hours of battery backup. While you may really have to be incredibly frugal with your usage to get that sort of battery backup time, it is very much a reality that this laptop is not going to give you any battery anxiety either. A fully charged Dell Latitude 7400 2-in-1 will easily last you two regular days at work without you having to plug in the charger at all. And that is the sort of luxury that Dell has been able to extract from the Latitude 7400 2-in-1 even without having switched to the newer 9th generation or 10th generation Intel processors.</p>",

Two of these anticipated new features and performance improvements, including continuous Eye Detection focus tracking and unlocking continuous auto-exposure at the cameras&#39; fastest burst rates,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imaging-resource.com/news/2019/05/16/nikon-firmware-update-eye-af-shootout-nikon-z6-vs-sony-a7-III\">arrived this past summer with a v2.0 firmware update.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remaining two unveiled features, support for RAW video recording and CFexpress memory cards, were notably missing. The Nikon Z cameras,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/nikon-z6/nikon-z6VIDEO.HTM\">especially the Z6</a>, already offer impressive video specs, including full-width 4K recording, full pixel readout 4K (on the Z6), N-Log, 4:2:2 10-bit output and image stabilization. The addition of RAW video recording, in particular, would make the Z cameras even more impressive to the video world, rivaling dedicated cinema cameras and making the Nikon Z7 and Z6 the first in the &quot;full-frame mirrorless&quot; market to offer RAW video support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.imaging-resource.com/?ACT=44&amp;fid=17&amp;d=9194&amp;f=z6-video-rig.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But now the wait is over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the release of Firmware v2.2, which adds support for super-fast CFexpress memory cards, Nikon has also announced details on how to add RAW video support to your Z6 or Z7 cameras. But unfortunately, it&#39;s not just a simple software update for this new feature, but rather a standalone service upgrade that costs $199.95 and requires you to send your camera into a Nikon Service Center.</p>",
